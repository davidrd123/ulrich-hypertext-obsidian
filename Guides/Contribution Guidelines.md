# Contribution Guidelines

## Types of Contributions
1. **Expanding Existing Nodes**: Adding depth to current concepts
2. **Creating New Layer 1 Nodes**: Adding new interpretive lenses
3. **Adding Compressed Diamonds**: Creating focused explorations
4. **Improving Navigation**: Enhancing links and structure

## Node Creation Process

### For Layer 1 Nodes
1. Identify a clear theoretical framework or perspective
2. Create a new file in the Layer 1 Nodes directory
3. Follow the structure:
   - Poetic Compression (2-3 stanzas)
   - Discursive Exposition (clear explanation)
   - Connections (links to related nodes)
4. Link to the central node and at least 2 other nodes

### For Compressed Diamonds
1. Focus on a specific insight, practice, or application
2. Create a new file in the Compressed Diamonds directory
3. Use primarily poetic form (100-300 words)
4. Include minimal explanatory text
5. Link to relevant Layer 1 and Central nodes

## Writing Guidelines

### Poetic Compression
- Use concise, image-rich language
- Employ enjambment to create conceptual tension
- Balance abstract concepts with embodied imagery
- Embed hyperlinks within the poetic text

### Discursive Exposition
- Begin with a clear framing sentence
- Use bullet points for key concepts
- Keep explanations under 200 words
- End with practical implications

## Formatting
- Use Markdown formatting consistently
- Include section headers (## for main sections)
- Use --- to separate poetic and discursive sections
- Format links as [[Node Name]]
