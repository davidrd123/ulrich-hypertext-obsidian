# Project Vision: Recursive Hyperlink Field

## Conceptual Framework
The **Ulrich Insight** transcends mere literary analysis. It's a dynamic recursive construct where meaning emerges through multi-scale resonances. Each node functions as a "diamond," densely encoding narrative, conceptual, philosophical, neuroscientific, and experiential layers.

## Core Principles

### 1. Poetic Compression
Content is compressed into dense, poetic forms that encode complex ideas through imagery, rhythm, and juxtaposition. This compression creates a high information-to-word ratio.

### 2. Recursive Structure
The vault's structure mirrors its content - a document about recursion is itself recursively structured. Nodes reference each other, creating loops of meaning.

### 3. Multi-Scale Integration
Ideas are explored across scales - from neural oscillations to social narratives, from embodied experience to abstract theory.

### 4. Dynamic Decompression
Content unfolds through exploration. Initial encounters provide compressed insights, with deeper layers revealed through continued engagement.

## Interaction Model
- Begin with compressed poetic nodes
- Follow hyperlinks to expand understanding
- Return to central nodes with new insights
- Create new connections between existing nodes
- Add new compressed diamonds as insights emerge

## Long-Term Vision
This project aims to create a living, evolving exploration of recursion that can be:
- A personal thinking tool
- A collaborative knowledge structure
- A model for non-linear, poetic knowledge representation
- A practical guide to recursive awareness in daily life
