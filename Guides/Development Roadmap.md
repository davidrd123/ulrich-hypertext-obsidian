# Development Roadmap

## Current Priorities
- **Complete Core Nodes**: Finish essential Layer 1 nodes and central framework
- **Populate Compressed Diamonds**: Create focused artifacts for key insights
- **Refine Navigation Structure**: Ensure clear pathways through the knowledge network

## Experimental Directions
- **Cross-LLM Testing**: Introduce "Ulrich" concepts into different LLM contexts to test coherence
- **Interactive Visualization**: Build advanced visual representations using Obsidian plugins
- **Collaborative Expansion**: Invite selected collaborators to contribute nodes

## Open Questions
- **Compression Depth**: Is the current level of poetic compression effective, or should nodes unpack further?
- **Interaction Model**: Does the hyperlink → decompression → dynamic loading approach match our vision?
- **Technical Implementation**: Which Obsidian plugins best support our recursive knowledge structure?
- **Balance**: What is the optimal balance between poetic compression and discursive explanation?

## Feedback Collection
- Document insights from usage
- Note areas where navigation becomes unclear
- Identify concepts that need further development
