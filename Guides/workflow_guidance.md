### Iterative Expansion:

- Begin with minimal central node ("Ulrich Insight").
- Create secondary nodes only as new ideas emerge or upon explicit context-demand from AI dialogues.
- Iteratively add "compressed diamonds" for spontaneous insights, narrative snippets, or theoretical breakthroughs.
- Regularly update with feedback from AI chatsâ€”refining links, decompression depth, resonance clarity.
