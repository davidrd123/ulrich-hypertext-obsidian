## Vision of Interaction: Dynamic Decompression via LLM

Imagine an AI-enhanced Obsidian environment:

- You reference "[[Ulrich's Recursive Insight]]" in another conversation.
- LLM notes ambiguity or curiosity, queries Obsidian.
- Obsidian dynamically sends context nodes ("Musilâ€™s Moonlit Walk," "Recursive Embodiment") back to the chat.
- LLM integrates and reflects this deeper context into the ongoing dialogue, expanding layers recursively as needed.
