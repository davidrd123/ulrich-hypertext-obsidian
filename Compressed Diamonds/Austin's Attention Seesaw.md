# Austin's Attention Seesaw

## Poetic Compression

Attention oscillates  
Egocentric inward,  
Allocentric outward—  
Neural rhythms swing,  
Self fades, space sharpens.

---

egocentric focus narrows,
self-reference tightens—
breath shifts,
neural currents change course,
allocentric awareness expands.

---

the seesaw tips,
vertigo transforms to presence.

---

Ulrich, caught  
In recursion's spin,  
Finds balance  
In allocentric breath,  
Embodied stillness.

## Discursive Exposition

James Austin's neurological framework provides the physiological basis for [[Ulrich's Recursive Insight|Ulrich's]] existential oscillations:

- **Egocentric processing**: Dorsal attention network creates self-referential loops (Ulrich's vertigo)
- **Allocentric processing**: Ventral attention network enables panoramic, self-transcendent awareness (moonlit clarity)

The "seesaw" represents the dynamic balance between these neural modes, mediated by breath and attention:

1. Breath rate influences neural oscillations
2. Oscillations shift balance between networks
3. Network dominance determines phenomenological experience

This neurodynamic framework grounds [[Recursive Embodiment|recursive embodiment]] in specific neural circuits, offering both explanation and potential intervention for Ulrich's condition.
