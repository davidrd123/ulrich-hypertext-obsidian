# Breath's Recursive Edge

loop unravels,
self pulses inward,
breath threads awareness—
allocentric moonlight
quietly reflects
hemispheric tides.

hands build silence,
mind rotates,
time blooms narrative
from neurons outward,
fractal
and embodied.

I dance recursion—
gravity ignores belief,
yet minds spin worlds
from stories we breathe.

This poetic compression interweaves multiple conceptual lenses around [[Ulrich's Recursive Insight|Ulrich's]] condition:

- [[Recursive Embodiment|Austin's neural oscillations]] between attention modes
- [[McGilchrist's Hemisphere|McGilchrist's hemispheric balance]]
- [[Musil's Moonlit Walk|Musil's embodied encounter]]
- [[Hyperstitional Narrative Waveforms|Narrative recursion]]

The compression serves as both analysis and practice—a meditation on how embodied awareness can temporarily resolve the vertigo of recursive self-reference.
